# Practices of Mastery

Welcome to the repo for the [practicesofmastery.com](http://practicesofmastery.com) website.

Since [practicesofmastery.com](http://practicesofmastery.com) is dedicated to spreading the knowledge of continuous delivery of software, it makes sense that contributing to the site uses some of the practices we espouse.

# Hey, I want to contribute!

Sweet! We totally want you to contribute. We also want you to be attributed with the contribution. And we want to make sure that everyone gets to share in the magical knowledge that you have to impart. Also, we hope that some people learn a thing or two by contributing.

Here's the process of contributing to the site. You can follow the [Very Quick Primer on Git](http://www.stage.practicesofmastery.com/post/a-very-quick-primer-on-git/) for an example with more detail.

### Naming conventions

- The name of the branch, directory and markdown file for your article must be named after your article, all in lowercase, prefixed by "article-" and spaces replaced by -'s.
- For example if your article is called "Some Interesting Things", then you will have:
  - branch: *article-some-interesting-things*
  - directory: *article-some-interesting-things/*
  - file: *article-some-interesting-things.md*

### Process

1. Clone this repo on Github: [https://github.com/danacton/practices-of-mastery](https://github.com/danacton/practices-of-mastery)
2. Create a local and remote branch named after your article (see naming conventions above)
3. On that branch, create a directory named after your article (see naming conventions above)
2. Write an article on a practice of mastery - choose from any of those indicated on the site. Create the article as a Markdown document named after your article (see naming conventions above)
3. Push your changes to the Github repo
3. Create a pull request on Github to merge your branch with master
4. Once the pull request is reviewed, your reviewer will merge to master and let you know your article has been published
