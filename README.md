# Practices of Mastery

Welcome to the repo for the [practicesofmastery.com](http://practicesofmastery.com) website.

Since [practicesofmastery.com](http://practicesofmastery.com) is dedicated to spreading the knowledge of continuous delivery of software, it makes sense that contributing to the site uses some of the practices we espouse.

# Hey, I want to contribute!

Sweet! We totally want you to contribute. We also want you to be attributed with the contribution. And we want to make sure that everyone gets to share in the magical knowledge that you have to impart. Also, we hope that some people learn a thing or two by contributing.

Details about how to contribute can be found in the Contributing page of the site or in the [Github repo](https://github.com/danacton/practices-of-mastery/blob/master/article-contributing/article-contributing.md)
